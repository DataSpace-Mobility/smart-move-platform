                <p>
                  Smart MOVE is global competition regarding proposing data
                  driven solutions to address mobility challenges faced by
                  Indian cities. The data challenge is outlined considering the
                  Government of India’s efforts to become Aatma Nirbhar
                  (self-reliant) and help cities to transform into a digitally
                  empowered society.
