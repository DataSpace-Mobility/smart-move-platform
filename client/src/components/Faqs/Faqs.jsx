                <p>
                  Smart MOVE is global competition regarding proposing data
                  driven solutions to address mobility challenges faced by
                  Indian cities. The data challenge is outlined considering the
                  Government of Indiaâ€™s efforts to become Aatma Nirbhar
                  (self-reliant) and help cities to transform into a digitally
                  empowered society.
